        <h1>DOCTOR <em>WHO?</em></h1>
        <p>Doctor Who is the worlds longest-running sci-fi series, having played on British television and all over the world - from 1963 right up to the present day.</p>

          <p>The story revolves around The Doctor, a Time Lord who traverses space and time in his TARDIS, which stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. it is a ship that is huge on the inside but looks like a small blue Metropolitan Police Box from the 1950's on the outside. He is usually accompanied by a companion, and battles the likes of the villainous Daleks and Cybermen as he endeavours to save the universe from evil.</p>

          <p>Doctor Who originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There followed a 1996 TV movie, before the show was revived in 2005 by BBC Wales in Cardiff.</p>

          <p>There have been 13 Doctors in total thus far, with the character regenerating (a biological process that allows the Doctor to stay alive but in an other form that cause the brain cells to change that result in change of personallity and apperance) to allow new actors to take the part. The Doctor is currently played by Peter Capaldi, portraying his 12th official incarnation. The Doctor always travels with a human companion, the last of whom was Clara Oswald, played by Jenna Coleman.</p>
